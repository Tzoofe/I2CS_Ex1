# Ex1 – Polynomial Functions

Created for Ariel University's *Introduction to Computer Science course*, this project provides a library of static functions to manipulate polynomials using double arrays.

---
# Some of the Functionality implemeneted in this file:
* Value Calculation: Computes the value of a polynomial f(x) for any given input.

* Root Finding: Implements a recursive algorithm to locate roots (zeroes) of the function.

* Interpolation: Generates linear or quadratic polynomials from a set of 2D points.

* Calculus & Geometry: Approximates the length of a curve and the area enclosed between two functions.

* Algebraic Operations: Supports addition, multiplication, and differentiation of polynomials.

* String Parsing: Converts mathematical strings into usable arrays and formats arrays back into text.

* Equality Check: Validates if two different arrays represent the mathematically equivalent function.
